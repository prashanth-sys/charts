# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Hii nxtwave and probz.AI team 
my self prashanth kumar reddy 

this is all about my react project how it done with various elements 
It done though third-party-packeages in react 

Here are some key points about the React.js project with a Line Chart component:

Project Setup: Initialized with create-react-app and added recharts for charting.

Component Structure:

Chart Component: Renders a responsive Line Chart using Recharts library.
TimeframeSelector: Allows switching between daily, weekly, and monthly data views.
Data Handling:

Data stored locally in the Chart component.
Filtered based on selected timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly).
Styling:

Responsive design using CSS media queries.
Adjusted chart height and font sizes for different screen sizes.
Functionality:

Clickable buttons in TimeframeSelector update the displayed timeframe.
Tooltip on the chart shows detailed data on hover.
Deployment:

Suitable for deployment on various devices due to responsive design.
Uses create-react-app for easy deployment and management.
This setup ensures a scalable and responsive React.js application with interactive charting capabilities. 

Thankyou
